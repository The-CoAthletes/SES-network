                <p>Sai’s journey towards sports science started right from his childhood by watching and playing different sports which not only excited him but eventually led to finding a degree in it along with a genuine interest towards SnC. Ever since, he feels that the amount of exposure in terms of learning and experience that this field has brought him has been enormous, which pushed him to currently pursue masters degree too. He truly believes that his contribution in the foreseeable future will bring a lot of accolades to the field of sports science in India and SES without a doubt being a starting point to it.</p>

                <p>Gayatri’s passion for sports and dance has carried through over the years and she is immensely grateful that she could convert this into her dream career by pursuing sports and exercise sciences. It is her vision to develop the sporting culture and high performance sports system in India from the grassroots up to the elite level. As a stepping stone to this she founded The SES Network to spread awareness on how science is an integral part of sport development and how the various professionals could come together to form a robust sporting ecosystem. 
At present she is pursuing her Masters in Kinesiology at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver.</p>

                <p>Sports was always a big part of Soorya’s life, culminating during his days of being a national level tennis player. Despite having to move from sport as a professional athlete, sport still stayed in his life as he undertook an undergraduate degree in Sports and Exercise Sciences. He feels that the success of India in sport is largely dependent on the grassroots of the nation in terms of the people and the nurturing structure, which need a lot of attention. 
Being a part of The SES Network and forming connections with some of the upcoming minds in the industry will add value to his 5+ years of experience in Strength and Conditioning, along with the Master’s degree in the same field that he is currently pursuing.</p>
